# GUICrypt

My first c project

A small encryption tool that exposed most of the symmetric cryptography fo [libtomcrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt)

The GUI is built with [nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) on top of opengl3/glfw

Depends on glfw, glew, opengl, and libtomcrypt.
