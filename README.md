# GUICrypt

My first c project

A small encryption tool that exposes most of the symmetric cryptography functionality of [libtomcrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt) (all common modes and ciphers)

The GUI is built with [nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) on top of opengl3/glfw

Depends on glfw, glew, opengl, and libtomcrypt.
