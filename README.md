# GUICrypt

## A small encryption tool that exposes most of the symmetric cryptography functionality of [libtomcrypt](https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt)

The GUI is built with [nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) on top of opengl3/glfw.

Also my first C project.

Depends on glfw, glew, opengl, and libtomcrypt.

Some of the options, the available options will change based off the selected cipher, mode, etc.
